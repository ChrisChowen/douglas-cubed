## About the Project

In 2022, generative AI arrived like an alien intelligence disguised as a funfair. Some students walked out of a class on AI — demoralised, unwilling to engage. This booklet, and this site, is what should have been said to them.

Douglas³ presents twenty-one neologisms — from *Indoor Fireworks* to *The Donkey Proverb* — that name the uncanny feelings we get when we co-create with machines that feel half alive and half conscious. Together they resolve into a handful of key differences between human creativity and generative AI.

### Why Douglas³?

All the best philosophers are called Douglas: **Adams**, **Rushkoff**, **Coupland**.
